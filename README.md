<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


As a group, our goal is to deliver an app that would combine the structures of open source research with an interactive/ subscription based framework that would allow a user to access multiple resources through a search point. The concept of this app will not only be resourceful but interactive through the user’s ability to input information that the user finds interesting, useful, resourceful, etc. into the app.

### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Abstract](https://www.abstractapi.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started you will need to install some frameworks. The frontend of our website was written in React to display user interfaces in a visually appealing way. The code that powers the backend of our website is in Python, using Flask. Flask Login will be used to manage user sessions. The app is deployed using Heroku. Heroku will also be used to storet he database using Heroku Postgres. Flask SQLAlchemy will be used to create the database models. An COMMUNICATIONS API will be used to send out verification information which can ensure integrity of the facts submitted.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following on your host before deployment
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* python3
  ```sh
  npm install python3@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free Email API Key at [https://www.abstractapi.com/](https://www.abstractapi.com/)
2. Setup a Heroku repository [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)
3. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chrisuga/group-12-final-project.git
   ```
4. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
5. NPM run build    
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
6. Enter your API in `.env`
7. Install Python libraries 
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.tx
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can use this webapp to post facts and verify other's facts. You can also discover new facts to learn for yourself.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

As a regular user, I should be able to verify my identity with an email authentication system, so I can be confident my reputation isn’t sullied by ne’er-do-wells.
The app should present a proper webpage where a visible login button is visible on the top right corner.
When the client interacts with the login button by clicking on it, the client should be able to sign in to their account by inputting a proper username and password. 
If the username and password is accepted by the system the client’s username will be displayed on the upper right hand corner.
If the username and password is rejected or does not match any in the database, the client will receive an error message and will be redirected to the login page.
Client’s username will automatically be set as the email address. 


As a regular user, I should be able to submit a piece of information I want to share, along with a corresponding source, so that I can inform other users of interesting things I know.
On the app page the client will have the ability to submit pieces of information through comments as well as upload links to their sources.
The app page should display two different blocks where one on the left will be titled as “Interesting Information Submission”  and the corresponding right block will display “Source Link”. 
A “Submit” button must be properly functional below the two blocks in order for the client to successfully submit their documentation to the server. 
After every user’s submission, the app screen should display a message that informs the client that their “Submission is in Progress”. 
The app should also be able to cancel a submission. 

As a regular user, I should be able to receive an email notification when my submitted facts have been reviewed, so I can know I’m making a contribution to the app.
Once the client has been properly logged in and submitted information for the category, the app should send a log to their email concerning their submission.
When the user’s fact is verified and added to the rotating fact list, there should be a corresponding email that lets the user know.
If the fact is rejected, an email should be sent letting the user know why their submission was not accepted.
There should be a link in the email to the web app so the user can see their fact in the rotation.
The user’s profile page should update to include the recently verified fact.


As a regular user, I should be able to view a rotating selection of facts, so that I can choose to entertain myself with unfamiliar snippets of info.
When the app is opened a display of facts should appear.
The client should be able to interact with the app by clicking on an arrow to the right side of the screen to see different facts appear.
The most recent displayed facts should be stored and reviewable if the user decided to click an arrow on the left side of the screen.
On the card displaying the fact, there should be a reference to a source also submitted by the user.
The cards displayed should have the capability of being interactive by allowing the client to see other cards that share similarities with it. 


See the [open issues](https://github.com/chrisuga/group-12-final-project/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
